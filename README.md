# OpenCase
A simple, case-management-focused CRM for small altruistic organisations.

## Current Status
**13 May 2018** A demo site, with basic functionality is available at demo.opencase.org.uk. If you are interested, raise an issue and I will get the login to you somehow. 

## The Plan
OpenCase will be available as:
* A Drupal module, on drupal.org 
* A Drupal install profile / distribution
* A hosted service

## Find out more
* More details, including user stories for future development, can be found in the [OpenCase Gitbook](https://hoegrammer.gitbooks.io/zen-crm/content/)
* Use the feedback form on the demo site to contact the developer.
