# OpenCase
A simple, case-management-focused CRM for small altruistic organisations.

## Current Status
**24 July 2018** A demo site, with basic functionality is available at demo.opencase.org.uk. If you are interested, raise an issue and I will get the login to you somehow. 

## The Plan
OpenCase will be available as:
* A Drupal module, on drupal.org 
* A Drupal install profile / distribution
* A hosted service

## Find out more
* More details, including user stories for future development, can be found in the [OpenCase Gitbook](https://hoegrammer.gitbooks.io/zen-crm/content/)
* Raise an issue to contact the developer. 

## Differences between current version (v0.2.6, July 2018) and previous version ##

**Access control**: Previously everyone could see all cases. Now, users can see cases that they are involved in. By creating case you automatically become involve in it (although you can later be removed or remove yourself). Caseworkers can see all clients and volunteer co-ordinators can see all volunteers. Site admins and overseers can see everything.

**Editing types**: As a site admin you can now add, remove and configure types of actor, types of case and types of activity and you can configure fields on these and add your own fields.s

**Relations between types**: For each type of case, you can specify what types of actors (people) can be involved in it, e.g. for a volunteer recruitment case it would be volunteers and/or staff; for a legal advice case maybe clients, volunteers and solicitors. You can also specify what activities belong on what kinds of cases.
